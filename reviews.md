# Brief Reviews of What I've Read

## The Hidden Life of Trees by Peter Wohlleben 🧠 🐟

Kind of a popular science coverage of, what I take to be, the latest scientific
thoughts on forestry. Does a great job of keeping the technical discussion
accessible for the layperson. Each chapter is relatively independent of the
other chapters. Many interesting insights. I generally preferred the earlier
chapters of the books, which seemed to focus more on the forest as a
collaborative network and the symbiotic interactions between trees.
